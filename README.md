# MockQuizlet

#Purpose of the Program
The purpose of the program is to serve as a quizlet for learning new words. The user starts with a list of words, and the program constructs a dictionary witha word's various definitions. By randomly choosing a word and a definition, the program asks the user to provide the word that matches the definition.

For testing purposes, the program uses a list of three words: cat, dog, and computer.

The goal is for the program to form a quizlet out of a text file containing words that the user would like to know better.
